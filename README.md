# Rental Store
Idea: An application for a store that rents out items. 

#### Version
Frontend with JSON data files. 

## Steps
In order of how to complete this product from minimum product to extra features. 

#### Minimum Viable Product
As a staff member, I want to be able to search for avaiability of items, so I can see what is available for rent.

#### Rent Tracking
As a staff member, I want to track who rented items, so I can see what are the statuses of some items.

1.) As a staff member, I can check out items for customers, so I can keep track of items. 
2.) As a staff member, I can check in items for customers, so I can keep track of items.
3.) As a staff member, I can edit item stock, so I can keep track of items.

#### Payment
As a staff member, I want to calculate customer costs, so I can charge for penalties and for rents.
